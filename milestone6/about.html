                <h2>History & Development</h2>
                <p>South Korea has a rich history spanning over 5,000 years. The Korean Peninsula was unified under the Silla Dynasty in 668 CE, followed by the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392) and the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). After Japan's colonial rule (1910-1945) and the Korean War (1950-1953), the peninsula was divided into North and South Korea.</p>
                <p>Following the Korean War, South Korea experienced remarkable economic growth known as the "Miracle on the Han River." The country transformed from one of the world's poorest nations in the 1960s to a highly developed, high-income economy. Today, South Korea ranks as the world's 10th largest economy and is home to global brands like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG.</p>

                <h2>People & Society</h2>
                <p>With a population of approximately 51 million people, South Korea is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. About half of the population lives in the Seoul Capital Area, making it one of the largest metropolitan areas globally.</p>
                <p>South Korean society blends traditional Confucian values with modern global influences. The country places strong emphasis on education, with one of the highest literacy rates (98%) and university attendance rates worldwide. South Korea is ethnically homogeneous, with over 96% of residents being of Korean ethnicity.</p>
                <p>The official language is Korean (Hangul), and while many South Koreans can speak some English, particularly in tourist areas and among younger generations, learning basic Korean phrases can greatly enhance your visit.</p>
